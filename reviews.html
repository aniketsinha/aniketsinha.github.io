            I've been commuting to office mostly via means where someone else is driving. This means I get some time to catch up on some reading. Enter Amazon Kindle. Now I don’t have the Kindle device but I do have it’s app installed on My iPad and Phone. I have a lot of sample ebook as well as few paid books downloaded.
